# Versions
- **Example_original.ipynb** is the final code from the closing of the competition deadline (after doing efficientnetv2_b2, we moved on to efficientnetv2_b3 this is seen in this code)  
- **Example.ipynb** is the Google Colab recreated code of the best submission (efficientnetv2_b2)  
- **.env** is where you specify w&b team, API Key and project  

*Note: Some code blocks appear twice. This was necessary to make the notebook run correctly in Google Colab. For example, saving plots to a folder had to be modified slightly to work on Colab.*  

# Usage  
I would recommend you to just clear all existing cell outputs and then running the file again from top to bottom.

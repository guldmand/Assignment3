# Assignment 3: CNN Classification
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/assignment-3-cnn-classification-fall2025/

# Versions
- **Example_original.ipynb** is the final code from the closing of the competition deadline (after finishing EfficientNetV2-B2, we moved on to efficientnetv2_b3 this can be seen in this file)  
- **Example.ipynb** is the Google Colab–recreated version of the best submission (efficientnetv2_b2)  
- **.env** is where you specify W&B team, API Key and project. The team name can be a little tricky to find!  

*Note: Some code blocks appear twice. This was necessary to make the notebook run correctly in Google Colab. For example, saving plots to a folder had to be modified slightly to work on Colab.*  

# Usage  
I recommend clearing all existing cell outputs and then just running the notebook again from top to bottom.
